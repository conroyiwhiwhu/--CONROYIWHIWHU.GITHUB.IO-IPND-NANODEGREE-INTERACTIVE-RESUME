# Project

Stage 5: Choose Your Path

Choose one of four paths (Front-End, Back-End, Mobile, or Data Analyst) 
and complete a course and project of your choosing. Get a real sense 
of the kind of work that each of these developers do daily. 
All of the projects come straight from other Udacity courses or Nanodegree programs. 
If you choose to enroll in the Nanodegree related to your path, 
you will already have a jumpstart with credit for completing your chosen project.
